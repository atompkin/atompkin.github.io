                <h4>3D Modeling</h4>
                <p>The goal of this project was to recreate the 5th avenue apple store. The piece was created using Autodesk’s Maya to create the 3D model of the store. The outdoor area of the piece mirrored the Fifth Avenue Apple Stores iconic glass cube design. The stores interior contained the beautiful, glass spiral stair case and glass elevator. The store’s glass textures were created using Maya’s Hyper sphere tool. The two glass textures are the strongest part of the piece. The frosted and non frosted glass both reflect light in a similar manner to the physical building. Recreating the multiple layers of glass and how they intersect gives the piece a striking appearance. The elevator and stair case stand out form the outer walls of the building. The stairs where the hardest part of the piece to create. Creating a spiral staircase is much harder when it is transparent. In the end the stair case and elevator came out better than expected. The surrounding area does not have the same level of polish as the stair in elevator. This is due to the amount of time taken on the glass stair case, however more work adding to the store interior could bring this piece to the next level.</p>

                <h4>3D Modeling</h4>
                <p>This piece is one of the first models I did in Maya. It is a dimly lit room in a space station with a hologram projecting the solar system. Outside of the space station is the planet earth to suggest that the station is in orbit around earth. The dark room is light up by the subtle glow of blue from the projection device. The room’s lighting needs to be brightened and is the weakest part of the piece. The room has a nice atheistic, however with the poor lighting it is difficult to make out the interior design. The blue lighting gives a contrast to the earth which acts as a bright beacon in comparison to the dark surrounding room. The earth and the sun appear to pop of the screen when surrounded with the dark abyss of space.</p>

                <h3>Space Escape</h3>
                <h4>Game</h4>
                <p>The Shipping Compartment game is an escape game created in unity. The goal of the game is to make it to the vent with the green light on the other side of the cargo hold. The game is a first person platformer with an element of physics based puzzles. All of the crates in the room can be moved. Their size determines the easy at which the crates can be pushed. The shipping containers are to large to push and therefore cannot be moved. The player can move the boxes around to give them a better path to the vent or can decide to use the existing placement to get onto one of the shipping containers and platform to the vent. The game is meant to resemble the cargo hold of spaceship that the player is trying to escape from. This was the first game I created in unity and is rather simplistic however it demonstrates my ability to utilize unity to create 3D interactive environments.</p>

                <h3>N-Queens</h3>
                <h4>Programming</h4>
                <p>The project was to create a program to determine if it is possible to place N number of queens on a chess board that is NxN. The program used a recursion formula to find every possible solution. If a solution exist it is placed on the GUI interface. The efficiency at which the program ran but that is not the only part of the assignment that. I had extra time that week that I was able to use on the GUI interface. For the GUI interface I wanted to go a more rustic feel, I used lighter and darker colored woods to make the board. Instead of using a traditional queen chess piece icon as the representation for the queens, used a fan made iron logo for the band queen. Using the hand made rock band logo gave my project more personality and set it apart from the traditional GUI interface. To add to the whole, I made the background color of the program a light brown color to complement the wooden board. I feel that the final product was a nice fresh look for a fairly standard programing problem. The NQueens problem is well known however it was the creative way that I approached the design of the algorithm and the fun, playful GUI interface that set it apart. I feel this assignment is a great example of what can happen if a project is given time for polish.</p>
