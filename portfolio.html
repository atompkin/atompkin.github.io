                <h4>3D Modeling</h4>
                <p>The goal of this project was to recreate the 5th avenue apple store. The piece was created using Autodesk’s Maya to create the 3D model of the store. The outdoor area of the piece mirrored the Fifth Avenue Apple Stores iconic glass cube design. The stores interior contained the beautiful glass spiral stair case and glass elevator. The store’s glass textures were created using Maya’s Hyper sphere tool. The two glass textures are the strongest part of the piece. The frosted and non frosted glass both reflect light in a similar manner to the physical building. Recreating the multiple layers of glass and how they intersect gives the piece a striking appearance. The elevator and stair case stand out form the outer walls of the building. The stairs were the hardest part of the piece to create. Creating a spiral staircase is much harder when it is transparent. In the end the stair case and elevator came out better than expected this resulted in the stairs having more polish than the surrounding area.</p>

                <p>This piece is one of the first models I did in Maya. It is a dimly lit room in a space station with a hologram projecting the solar system. Outside of the space station is the planet Earth to suggest that the station is in orbit around Earth. The dark room is light up by the subtle glow of blue from the projection device. The room’s lighting needs to be brightened and is the weakest part of the piece. The room has a nice aesthetic, however with the poor lighting it is difficult to make out the interior design. The blue lighting gives a contrast to the earth which acts as a bright beacon in comparison to the dark surrounding room. The earth and the sun appear to pop out of the screen when surrounded with the dark abyss of space.</p>

                <h4>Game</h4>
                <p>The Space Escape game is an escape game created in Unity3D. The goal of the game is to make it to the vent with the green light on the other side of the cargo hold. The game is a first person platformer with elements of physics based puzzles. All of the crates in the room can be moved. Their size determines the ease at which the crates can be pushed. The shipping containers are too large to push and therefore cannot be moved. The player can move the boxes around to give them a better path to the vent or can decide to use the existing placement to get onto one of the shipping containers and jump to the vent. The game is meant to resemble the cargo hold of spaceship that the player is trying to escape from. This was the first game I created in Unity3D and is rather simplistic; however it demonstrates my ability to utilize unity to create 3D interactive environments.</p>

                <h4>3D Modeling</h4>
                <p>The ray gun 3D model is another creation from Maya. The ray gun is one of the assets I created for my final project in Advanced 3D Modeling and Animation. This piece is acting as a place holder for the final project which is a game that was created in Unity3D similar to space escape. For the design of the ray gun I wanted to go for a retro aesthetic, which is why I used a classic red and yellow color scheme. For the barrel shape I wanted to move away from the sphere at the end of the ray gun and decided to go for a shape that resembled a black powered blunderbuss. The body of the ray gun mimics the atomic gun toy line from the mid 1900s. If this was a standalone piece, I would have painted more details onto the sides of the ray gun to give it more of a pop. However, knowing that it would be used in a third-person platformer game, I realized it would be very difficult to make out the sides of the model. </p>

                <h4>360 Tour</h4>
                <p>The Oscar Bluemner Virtual Tour was created to make a snapshot of the Spring 2017 Exhibit. The goal of the project was to create a fully interactive 360 tour of the exhibit. My role in the project was to translate the 360 images into a website that a user could easily interact with, and laid out all of the requirements of the project. The tour was built using a program called PanoTour Pro which allowed us to put multiple 360 images together into 360 tour. The final tour allowed the user to move around the exhibit in a way similar to google maps. All of the works had hotspots which could be clicked on to see a larger image of the work. The site had multiple ways of being navigated and supported mobile devices. The site was hosted on Github Pages to give the team an easily accessible website to show individuals for testing. The site also used an index page to redirect to the virtual tour which if more are added would be the central menu to access all of the different tours. This project uses of emerging 360 imagery and would be of great use to an individual that may never have the opportunity to visit the Oscar Bluemner Exhibit.</p>

                <h4>Programming</h4>
                <p>The project was to create a program to determine if it is possible to place an arbitrary number N of queens on a chess board that is NxN. The program uses a recursion formula to find every possible solution. If a solution exists, it is placed on the GUI interface. Building The program a recursive formula makes it the most efficient. I had extra time that week that I was able to spend on the GUI interface. For the GUI interface I wanted to go for a more rustic feel. I used lighter and darker colored woods to make the board. Instead of using a traditional queen chess piece icon as the representation for the queens, I used a fan made iron logo for the band queen. Using the hand made rock band logo gave my project more personality and set it apart from the traditional GUI interface. To add to the whole, I made the background color of the program a light brown color to complement the wooden board. I feel that the final product was a nice fresh look for a fairly standard programing problem. The NQueens problem is well known; however it was the creative way that I approached the design of the algorithm and the fun, playful GUI interface that set it apart. </p>

                <p>Technology has been a leading tool in education for the past century. Combining John Dewey’s philosophy of educational progressivism with Kim Kasten’s philosophy on geoscience education to create a new an exciting way to educate people about the phenomenon that occurs on the world we live on. Utilizing cutting edge technology such as 360 photography, photo scanning, and virtual reality to create a virtual field trips. We have been able to give the user the ability to teleport to interesting locations to learn and better understand the natural processes that led to its formation. Users are able to move about the stunning locations and interact with life like samples from the locations. This technology gives the user the ability to visit areas they may other wise not get to experience and do so with ease, all the while being able to play with emerging virtual reality technology.</p>
